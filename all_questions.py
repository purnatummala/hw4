There are combinations of attributes for which the outcome (DB = Yes or No) is not determined by the existing rules. In practice, for a rule set to be considered exhaustive, there should be a clear outcome specified for every possible combination of input attribute values."

For each node in layer k+1, the activation is determined by taking the weighted sum of outputs from the nodes in layer k, adding a bias, and then applying an activation function.So, when applying an ANN model to a test instance, the activations at nodes at the k+1th layer indeed rely on and are computed using the activations at nodes at the kth layer."

In such scenarios, it's generally best to choose a smaller value for K because the points within each class are tightly grouped together. Specifically, when K is set to 1, the performance tends to be slightly better in this context, as the risk of incorrect classification is low due to the limited number of neighbors considered. This situation presents a better class separation than in scenario A, suggesting that a larger K value, like 50, might not be ideal. Using such a high K could overly generalize the decision boundaries, which is why a smaller K would typically be the preferred choice in this case."
    answers["(b) explain"] = "In figure KNN (b), there is noticeable overlap among the classes, suggesting that individual instances might not accurately represent their class due to noise or overlapping boundaries. In such cases, a larger value of K is advisable because the classifier's decision is influenced by a broader range of neighbors, which helps mitigate the impact of noise. A balanced choice could be K = 5. This setting avoids overly smoothing the decision boundary, a common issue with K = 1, where the model might be overly influenced by outliers. Conversely, K = 5 provides enough detail to accurately reflect the complexities of the actual class boundaries, unlike K = 50, which might oversimplify the decision surface, leading to underfitting. While K = 50 could ignore critical nuances in the data, K = 5 strikes a balance, offering a more nuanced and accurate representation of the data's inherent structure"
